 * Prerequisites
   # An operation system supporting a Java 5 Platform. Linux, Mac OS X, MS Windows, Solaris or Open-Solaris ...
   # A Java 5 (or superior) Runtime installed. You can download the last stable version at <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Java Sun Official Site </a>. NB! At the moment to run Blite using JavaWeb Start you need a Java 6 Runtime but to run Blide from a downloaded distribution you need just a Java 5 Runtime. Besides the usage of a Java is discouraged. For a better user experience (performances, system look and feel integration) we heartily recommend to use the last version of Java 6 JRE.
