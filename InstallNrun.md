# Install and Run Blide #

  * Prerequisites
    1. An operation system supporting a Java 5 Platform. Linux, Mac OS X, MS Windows, Solaris or Open-Solaris ...
    1. A Java 5 (or superior) Runtime installed. You can download the last stable version at <a href='http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp'>Java Sun Official Site </a>.

> _NB! At the moment to run Blite using Javaweb Start or to run Blide from a downloaded distribution you need just a Java 5 Runtime. Besides the usage of a Java 5 is discouraged. For a better user experience (performances, system look and feel integration) we heartily recommend to use the last version of Java 6 JRE._
